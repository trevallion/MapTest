# MapTest

A simple Android app written in Kotlin that downloads a JSON array of geographical data, saves the data to a Room database, and displays the data in a MapBox map.

## Todo

- Implement a RecyclerView and corresponding adapters and bindings to display the rest of the data on screen.
- Add feature to add or remove map pins.
- Move some of the MapPinFragment logic to the MapViewModel.
